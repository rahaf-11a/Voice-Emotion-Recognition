# Voice-Emotion-Recognition
A speech emotion recognition project aimed at detecting early signs of depression by analyzing audio recordings. It identifies emotional patterns such as sadness, anger, and emotional flatnessâ€”common indicators of depressive states. The project uses audio feature extraction techniques (MFCC) and data augmentation methods to improve model accuracy.
